   accelerometer
      A common sensor used to measure acceleration in one or more axis.

   auto
      The first phase of each match is called Autonomous (auto) and consists of the robot's running pre-programmed instructions.

   call stack
      A specially-organized region of memory which helps the program keep track of what function it is in, and store the values of some variables. See `call stack <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack>`__ on wikipedia for more info.

   COTS
      Commercial off the shelf, a standard (i.e. not custom order) part commonly available from a vendor to all teams for purchase.

   C++
      One of the three officially supported programming languages.

   declarative programming
      A style of software which focuses on describing _what_ a program should do, rather than _how_ it gets done. See `declarative programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming>`__ on wikipedia for more info.

   deprecated
      Software that has been replaced and will no longer receive new features. Deprecated software will be maintained for at least 1 year, but may be removed after that. For example, if a method is deprecated prior to the 2022 season, it will be usable in the 2022 season, but may be removed prior to the 2023 season. Teams are encouraged to not use deprecated methods in new code.

   DHCP
      Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, the protocol that allows a central device to assign unique IP addresses to all other devices.

   FMS
      Field Management System, the electronics core responsible for sensing and controlling the FIRST Robotics Competition field.

   GradleRIO
      The mechanism that powers the deployment of robot code to the roboRIO.

   gyroscope
      A device that measures rate of rotation.  It can add up the rotation measurements to determine :term:`heading` of the robot. (“gyro”, for short)

   heading
      The direction the robot is pointed, usually expressed as an angle in degrees.

   IMU
      Inertial Measurement Unit, a sensor that combines both an :term:`accelerometer` and a :term:`gyroscope` into a single sensor.

   Java
      One of the three officially supported programming languages.

   KOP
      Kit of Parts, the collection of items listed on the Kickoff Kit checklists, distributed to the team via FIRST Choice, or paid for completely (except shipping) with a Product Donation Voucher (PDV).

   KOP chassis
      The KOP contains a drive base (chassis) distributed to every team (that did not opt out) as part of the :term:`KOP`. For the 2022 season, the KOP chassis is the `AM14U5 <https://www.andymark.com/products/am14u5-6-wheel-drop-center-robot-drive-base-first-kit-of-parts-chassis>`__.

   LabVIEW
      One of the three officially supported programming languages.

   NetworkTables
      A way to communicate key / value pairs of data between programs.

   simulation
      A way for teams to test their code without having an actual robot available.

   software library
      A collection of code that can be imported into and used by other software. See `software library <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)>`__ on wikipedia for more info.

   teleop
      The second phase of each match is called the Teleoperated Period (teleop) and consists of drivers controlling their robots.

   torque
      A force applied at a distance from some axis of rotation

   trajectory
      A trajectory is a smooth curve, with velocities and accelerations at each point along the curve, connecting two endpoints on the field.
