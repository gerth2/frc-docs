   accelerometer
      A common sensor used to measure acceleration in one or more axis.

   auto
      The first phase of each match is called Autonomous (auto) and consists of the robot's running pre-programmed instructions.

   call stack
      A specially-organized region of memory which helps the program keep track of what function it is in, and store the values of some variables. See `call stack <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack>`__ on wikipedia for more info.

   COTS
      Commercial off the shelf, a standard (i.e. not custom order) part commonly available from a vendor to all teams for purchase.

   compositions
      A formal software term a set of multiple objects (such as commands) grouped into a bigger object. See `object composition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition>`__ on wikipedia for more info.

   CTRP
      Continuously Recurring Template Pattern - A software idiom in which a class `X`` derives from a class template instantiation using `X`` itself as a template argument. See `CRTP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern>`__ on wikipedia for more info.

   C++
      One of the three officially supported programming languages.

   declarative programming
      A style of software which focuses on describing *what* a program should do, rather than *how* it gets done. See `declarative programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming>`__ on wikipedia for more info.

   dependency injection
      A software design pattern where each class receives all objects it depends upon as arguments to its constructor. See `dependency injection <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection>`__ on wikipedia for more info.

   deprecated
      Software that has been replaced and will no longer receive new features. Deprecated software will be maintained for at least 1 year, but may be removed after that. For example, if a method is deprecated prior to the 2022 season, it will be usable in the 2022 season, but may be removed prior to the 2023 season. Teams are encouraged to not use deprecated methods in new code.

   design pattern
      A particular, intentionally-chosen style of organizing code. A design pattern intentionally excludes using certain features of a programming language to constrain developers into solutions that are well-suited to a particular problem-space. See `design pattern. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern>`__ on wikipedia for more info. 

   DHCP
      Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, the protocol that allows a central device to assign unique IP addresses to all other devices.

   encapsulation
      A software design pattern which uses a class to hide the implementation details of other classes. See `encapsulation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)>`__ on wikipedia for more info.

   event-driven programming
      A style of programming where certain parts of code generate "events" as a result of some input (sensors, user interaction, etc). Then, other parts of code listen for and respond to "handle" these events. See `event-based <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming>`__ on wikipedia for more info.

   FMS
      Field Management System, the electronics core responsible for sensing and controlling the FIRST Robotics Competition field.

   GradleRIO
      The mechanism that powers the deployment of robot code to the roboRIO.

   gyroscope
      A device that measures rate of rotation.  It can add up the rotation measurements to determine :term:`heading` of the robot. (“gyro”, for short)

   heading
      The direction the robot is pointed, usually expressed as an angle in degrees.

   imperative programming
      A style of programming that focuses on *what* the code should be doing, step by step, every loop. See `imperative programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming>`__ on wikipedia for more info.

   IMU
      Inertial Measurement Unit, a sensor that combines both an :term:`accelerometer` and a :term:`gyroscope` into a single sensor.

   Java
      One of the three officially supported programming languages.

   KOP
      Kit of Parts, the collection of items listed on the Kickoff Kit checklists, distributed to the team via FIRST Choice, or paid for completely (except shipping) with a Product Donation Voucher (PDV).

   KOP chassis
      The KOP contains a drive base (chassis) distributed to every team (that did not opt out) as part of the :term:`KOP`. For the 2022 season, the KOP chassis is the `AM14U5 <https://www.andymark.com/products/am14u5-6-wheel-drop-center-robot-drive-base-first-kit-of-parts-chassis>`__.

   LabVIEW
      One of the three officially supported programming languages.

   NetworkTables
      A way to communicate key / value pairs of data between programs.

   recursive composition
      A software term for when an object is made up of many objects, including itself. For example, a command group may contain one or more command groups. See `recursive composition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition#Recursive_composition>`__ on wikipedia for more info.

   simulation
      A way for teams to test their code without having an actual robot available.

   software library
      A collection of code that can be imported into and used by other software. See `software library <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)>`__ on wikipedia for more info.

   state machine
      A programming construct that divides a problem into many discrete, well-defined, mutually-exclusive "states", then defines how the problem is solved by moving between different states. See `state machine <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine>`__ on wikipedia for more more info.

   teleop
      The second phase of each match is called the Teleoperated Period (teleop) and consists of drivers controlling their robots.

   torque
      A force applied at a distance from some axis of rotation

   trajectory
      A trajectory is a smooth curve, with velocities and accelerations at each point along the curve, connecting two endpoints on the field.
